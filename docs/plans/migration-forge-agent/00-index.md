# Migration to forge-agent - Index

For agents. This folder is the canonical place for migration plans and parity docs.

## Purpose

Migrate Writer and ForgeWorkspace nodes and Yarn implementation from dialogue-forge into forge-agent.
Do not migrate edge-drop (see [11-out-of-scope.md](11-out-of-scope.md)).

## Before you start

1. Read [01-agent-strategy-migration.md](01-agent-strategy-migration.md).
2. Read [11-out-of-scope.md](11-out-of-scope.md).
3. Read the specific plan you are executing (30-33) and [docs/agent-artifacts/core/STATUS.md](../../agent-artifacts/core/STATUS.md).

## After each slice

Update the plan Done list and Next section, then update [docs/agent-artifacts/core/MIGRATION.md](../../agent-artifacts/core/MIGRATION.md) with a one-line "Done" entry.
