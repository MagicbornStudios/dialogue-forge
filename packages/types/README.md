# @magicborn/types

Shared Payload CMS types for the monorepo. Studio runs `payload generate:types` and writes to `src/payload-types.ts`.

- **payload-types.ts**: Generated by Payload; may include `declare module 'payload'`. The types package lists `payload` as a devDependency so that augmentation resolves when building.
- **payload.ts**: Re-exports collection record types from `Config` (e.g. `ProjectRecord`, `ForgeGraphRecord`).

Consumers (studio, and optionally other packages) depend on `@magicborn/types` for Payload-backed types.
